1) What are the necessary preprocessing steps regarding:
a) classes ?
look the balance between classe : same number of samples in both classes? otherwise, choose another model(type SVM)

b) categorical features ? 
convert into binary value 0-1  or ordinal value (if distances between variables)

c) continuous features ?
center and standardized the values (Scaler()) 

2) Confusion matrix:
a)How many patient were incorrectly diagnosed with a Heart disease (false positives) ?
12
b)How many patient were incorrectly diagnosed as being Healthy (false negatives)?
5

3) Changing the threshold:
a)What is the precision if we change the threshold to have a 0.95 recall ? 
precision :  0.48148148148148145

b) How many patient were incorrectly diagnosed as being Healthy (false negatives)?
2 

4) Choosing an overall metric:

a) If I can compute my test sample probabilities and care more about the positive class, which overall metric should I use to compare classifiers ? 
we can use : ROC AUC score, Average precison 

b) And if I only have the class predictions and no probabilities ?
We can use : accuracy, precision, recall , Fbeta_score
